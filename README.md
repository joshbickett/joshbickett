### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! I am a software engineer at [HyperWrite](https://hyperwriteai.com), where we are building LLM-based writing tools. Our projects have included exploring the automation of web tasks using [AI agents](https://venturebeat.com/ai/hyperwrite-unveils-breakthrough-ai-agent-that-can-surf-the-web-like-a-human/).

In my personal projects, I am currently exploring Visual Language Models (VLMs) capabilities to [operate computers](https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-self-operating-computer-emerges/) and [play games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Znt4dMAB7U). 

I am also wrapping up the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) at DeepLearning.ai. I am interested in collaborating on research projects exploring VLMs' ability to reason and play games.

The easiest way to reach me is to message me on Twitter [@josh_bickett](https://twitter.com/josh_bickett).
