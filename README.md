### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! I am a software engineer at [HyperWrite](https://hyperwriteai.com), where we are building LLM-based writing tools. Our projects have included exploring the automation of web tasks using [AI agents](https://venturebeat.com/ai/hyperwrite-unveils-breakthrough-ai-agent-that-can-surf-the-web-like-a-human/).

In my personal projects, I am currently delving into VLMs' (Visual Language Models) capabilities to [operate computers](https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-self-operating-computer-emerges/) and [play games](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/youtuber-pits-chatgpt-against-super-104929439.html). This exploration is part of my broader interest in how AI can interact with and enhance our digital experiences.

I am also wrapping up the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) at DeepLearning.ai. I'm enthusiastic about applying what I've learned to real-world problems, particularly in research projects focused on the reasoning abilities of VLMs and their application in gaming environments.

I'm open to collaborations on projects exploring these innovative technologies. If you are interested in discussing potential research opportunities or just want to chat about AI innovations, feel free to reach out!
