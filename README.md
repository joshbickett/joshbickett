### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer at [HyperWrite](https://hyperwriteai.com), where we build LLM-based writing tools. In addition, we build & experiment with AI Agents [AI agents](https://venturebeat.com/ai/hyperwrite-unveils-breakthrough-ai-agent-that-can-surf-the-web-like-a-human/).

I created one of the first computer-use agents [operating computers](https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-self-operating-computer-emerges/) and also experimented with having AI agents' ability to [play games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Znt4dMAB7U). 

I'm now experimenting with the memory layer for AI agents. 

The easiest way to reach me is to message me on Twitter [@josh_bickett](https://twitter.com/josh_bickett).
