### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer at [HyperWrite](https://hyperwriteai.com), where we are building LLM-based writing tools. In addition, we've explored the automation of web tasks with [AI agents](https://venturebeat.com/ai/hyperwrite-unveils-breakthrough-ai-agent-that-can-surf-the-web-like-a-human/).

On the side, I am exploring Visual Language Models (VLMs) capabilities [operating computers](https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-self-operating-computer-emerges/) and [playing games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Znt4dMAB7U). 

I am also wrapping up the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) at DeepLearning.ai. 

The easiest way to reach me is to message me on Twitter [@josh_bickett](https://twitter.com/josh_bickett).
